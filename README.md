# Email-Sms-Spam-Classifier

## Objective : Prediction of Spam Email or SMS using Machine Learning

## Introduction : 
### Spam email is unwanted junk email sent out in massive amount or in bulk to an indiscriminate recipient list. Generally, spam is sent for commercial purposes. It is sent in massive volume by botnets, networks of infected computers. Spam email can often be a malicious attempt to gain access to your system. Spam prevents the user from making full and good utilization of cpu time, storage capacity and network bandwidth. It becomes a huge problem especially at times when there are Spam mails which come in between important business mails. Hence, it becomes inevitable to solve such problems which are encountered by spam email. So, this problem can be solved by using Machine Learning methods which can successfully detect and filter spam. 

## Problem Statement : 
### The person responsible for sending the spam messages is referred to as the spammer. Such a person gathers email addresses from different websites, chat rooms etc. The huge volume of Spam mails flowing through the computer networks have destructive effects on the memory space of the email server, communication bandwith, cpu power and user time. In all, existing system does not find spam mails effectively. Hence, it also results in untold financial losses to many users. It leads to low test and prediction accuracy, less security and also loss of data.

## So according to above problem statement, I have built the machine learning model which will predict the Email or SMS is Spam or Not Spam.
